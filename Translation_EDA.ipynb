    "# Translation Exploration & Data Cleaning\n",
    "Author Brian Tam, 11/02/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to clean the [Bible corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/oswinrh/bible) as an intermediate setup to prep it for moding.\n",
    "Specifically this initial process explored the different translations and their individual advantages:\n",
    "1. Total vocabulary (for the purposes of dimensionality reduction)\n",
    "2. How true to the original Greek/Hebrew is the translation\n",
    "For a detailed breakdown look [here](https://commonwaychurch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bibletranslationchart.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a huge variety of weird bible versions, includeing [this one](https://www.cnet.com/news/bible-from-a-z-software-rewrites-entire-king-james-version-alphabetically/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Utlimately I decided to use the BBE translation for its inhertly smaller vocabulary that leads to natural dimensionality reduction"
